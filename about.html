        Myself Harsh Nandal. I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at VIT-AP University with a dynamic portfolio of internships and leadership experiences across diverse domains. Over the past few years, I’ve contributed to multiple organizations in roles spanning web development, human resources, content creation, and campus ambassadorships.

I’ve interned with companies like Purple Technologies, CipherByte Technologies, and TechnoHacks EduTech, gaining hands-on experience in web and Java development. My work with Icy Tales and Microsoft Student Chapter has sharpened my skills in content writing and coordination. In addition, I’ve served as an HR intern at organizations like CollegeTips.in and SolutionGraph, where I developed expertise in communication, consulting, and team management.

As a driven individual, I thrive in collaborative environments and am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. I continue to seek out opportunities to grow, contribute meaningfully, and push the boundaries of my potential.
        <br><br>
        With a strong foundation in programming, data structures, and web development, I'm passionate about exploring modern tech stacks, collaborating on real-world projects, and continuously evolving as a developer.
